Satoshi Nakamoto's Whitepaper introduced the concept of a decentralized digital currency. What was the main innovation this document outlined?;Establishing a global financial network through national banks.;Creating a new type of internet protocol for secure communication.;A blockchain system for recording and verifying transactions without relying on any central authority.;Developing an anonymous social media platform based on encryption.;C;4;14;18;Satoshi Nakamoto's innovation was the introduction of Bitcoin, a digital currency secured by cryptography and the immutable nature of the blockchain.;ai_generated
What is the role of the 'Proof-of-Work' mechanism in mining Bitcoin?;Determining the value of Bitcoin by creating a decentralized market system.;Storing and managing user-specific wallets within the blockchain.;Ensuring the security of the Bitcoin network by randomly assigning block validation.;A computational process that verifies and adds blocks to the blockchain with a competitive effort.;D;4;14;18;Proof-of-Work requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems, competing for blocks and rewarding them with bitcoins. This process ensures the integrity and security of the Bitcoin network.;ai_generated
What are Wallets used for in the context of Bitcoin?;Facilitating direct communication between individuals on the blockchain.;Enabling payment for goods and services using traditional banking methods.;Storage and management of private keys that enable transactions.;Issuing Bitcoin to users through a central authority.;C;4;14;18;Wallets provide a secure environment where users can store their Bitcoin private keys. This allows them to access, send and receive payments within the Bitcoin network.;ai_generated
What is the primary benefit of Blockchain technology in terms of decentralization?;Eliminating the need for a central authority or trusted third-party entity to manage transactions.;Increasing regulatory compliance and control over financial activity.;Promoting international money transfers without intermediaries.;Reducing transaction fees associated with traditional banking systems.;A;4;14;18;Blockchain technology eliminates the need for a central authority by recording transactions in a decentralized ledger, ensuring transparency and security.;ai_generated
What is the impact of Bitcoin's 'Decentralization' on traditional financial institutions?;Incentivizes them to adopt new technologies like blockchain for improved efficiency.;Promotes the expansion of digital currencies, leading to a decrease in cash usage.;Forces them to relinquish control over financial transactions and market regulation.;It challenges their role as intermediaries and creates potential competition for services.;D;4;14;18;Bitcoin's decentralized nature challenges traditional financial institutions by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. This creates both opportunities for innovation and potential competition.;ai_generated
